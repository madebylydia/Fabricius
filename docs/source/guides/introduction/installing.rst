               .. code-block:: bash

                  echo 'export PATH="$(brew --prefix)/opt/python@3.12/bin:$PATH"' >> "$([ -n "$ZSH_VERSION" ] && echo ~/.zprofile || ([ -f ~/.bash_profile ] && echo ~/.bash_profile || echo ~/.profile))"
                  export PATH="$(brew --prefix)/opt/python@3.12/bin:$PATH"

Ensure Python is installed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you're done following the instructions above, please make sure you have Python installed by opening a new terminal on your system.
You can check if Python is installed by running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   python --version

Also make sure that ``pip`` is installed by running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m pip --version

If one of this command fails, you should check your installation and try again.

Hint, Google's your friend

Installing Fabricius
--------------------

Once Python (and pip) is installed on your system, you can now download Fabricius.

We recommand to not install Fabricius in a virtual environment (As you usually would do) because it is a tool you're supposed to use globally.

You can install Fabricius using different tool, either with ``pip`` or ``pipx``. Feel free to choose whatever you'd prefer.

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Using pip

      To install Fabricius using ``pip``, you can run the following command:

      .. code-block:: bash

         python -m pip install fabricius

      This is the most straightforward way to install Fabricius.

   .. tab-item:: Using pipx

       More information about pipx can be found `here <https://github.com/pypa/pipx>_`.

       You first need to install pipx on your system using the following command:

       .. code-block:: bash

          python -m pip install pipx

       Once done, you can install Fabricius with the following command:

       .. code-block:: bash

          pipx install fabricius

Ensure Fabricius is installed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To check if Fabricius has been successfully installed on your system, open a new terminal and run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   fabricius --version

In case the command fail, it might probably just because the Fabricius's command has not been added to your Path.
Pip should warn you if this is the case, if so, you should follow the instruction given by pip to add Fabricius to your Path.

However, if the command worked just fine, congratulations, you're now ready to use Fabricius! âœ¨
