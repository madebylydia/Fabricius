Fabricius: The modern Py3k template renderer
============================================

.. caution::

   The documentation is **NOT READY!**

   That means that the code you might see in here is probably outdated, and requires update.
   Same goes to terms used in the documentation (E.g: ``Composers`` used to be called ``Renderers``).

   Feel free to explore and see what Fabricius has to offer, however, and until `1.0.0` is released, this documentation should be considered as a **draft**.

.. note::

   State of documentation: Completed at ``5%``/``100%``

   State of Fabricius: Completed at ``40%``/``100%``

**Fabricius** (Latin word, meaning "Artisan" ``\aʁ.ti.zɑ̃\`` in French, translatable into "Craftman") is a Python CLI tool which permit the render of projects templates.

Why should you use Fabricius?

* ``Supports CookieCutter``: CookieCutter templates are 100% usable with Fabricius and can be used as if you were using the CookieCutter CLI tool.
* ``Extendable``: You can extend the behavior of Fabricius as you wish, make use of a complete and documented API.
* ``Developer friendly``: Key point of Fabricius is its models, not only limited to be a CLI tool, you can also use its objects to create great tools for yourself, or... just use it as you'd like to!
* ``Modern``: Written using Python 3.12, Fabricius will never let a developer down! Enjoy type-hinting as you hear it!
* ``Crash-free``: We'll do our best to make sure Fabricius is as stable as possible, and if it crashes, an update will be shipped ASAP!

Guides

.. important::
   Guides are not ready yet!

   Fabricius need more time to get ready! While we're working on the documentation too, Fabricius is **not ready**!
   Guides (for now) are here to show you how Fabricius can work  and how you should expect things to work out.

API

.. topic:: Achtung, achtung! ⚠️

   This section is reserved for the peoples that are interested to use more complex tools in order to better understand how Fabricius works behind the scene & use it themselves.

   If you believe your use case is easy to tackle down, then you probably don't need to dig into the Fabricius's API.
